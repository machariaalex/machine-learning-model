# Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This repository provides an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP), a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP techniques enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, opening up a wide range of applications such as sentiment analysis, language translation, text summarization, and more.
