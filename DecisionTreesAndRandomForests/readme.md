# Decision Trees and Random Forests
This repository provides an introduction to Decision Trees and Random Forests, popular machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. Decision Trees are simple yet powerful models that learn decision rules from the data, while Random Forests combine multiple Decision Trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting.
